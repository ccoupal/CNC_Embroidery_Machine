# CNC Embroidery Machine

## Motivation and Overview
I was motivated to work on this project follwing a year working in a machine shop where CNCs are used. I have had some expierence programming, setting up, and running these machines. I wanted to build something of a cnc machine for myself.

I am an avid sewer and designer of oudoor gear, I sell these items to friends and other like minded individials. Doing embridery could add value to my items and not cost me much money.

This machine is made with a scrap Geeetech i3, Singer Featherweight sewing machine, Ardunio Uno, CNC Shield, and GRBL with UGS.
